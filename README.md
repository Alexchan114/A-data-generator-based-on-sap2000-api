# A-data-generator-based-on-sap2000-api
This is a data generator based on Sap2000 api, you can build a frame structure model in sap2000 and define the mass source and load pattern and other parameters according to your needs, this data generator will allow you to randomly generate uniform size uniform loads on each virtual surface and output the structural analysis results you need. This tool is suitable for generating large amounts of data for machine learning and can be easily converted to pytorch tensor format.

Be adviced: you need sap2000 api to run this project.
